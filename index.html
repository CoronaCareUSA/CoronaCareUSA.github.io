			<h1>Meet CoronaCare!</h1>
			<p>We are working day and night to bring you Corona Care USA, a platform that will connect people who need and can give financial help ...one bag of groceries at a time.  </p>
			<h2>So how will it work?</h2>
			<p>People who need help will create a short profile with the cost of their upcoming groceries.  People who can help will select a person or family’s profile and pay for their upcoming groceries.  Corona Care will email the person or family in need a virtual grocery gift card.  
			<h2>So what’s taking so long?</h2>
			<p>We’re forming partnerships with grocery store chains across the country. We’re registering as a charity in all 50 states. And we’re ensuring our website is a seamless experience.  But we’ll be ready to connect people in the next few weeks!  </p>
